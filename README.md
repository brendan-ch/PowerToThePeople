# PowerToThePeople

A [CruzHacks 2024](https://cruzhacks.com) project created by [Brendan](https://github.com/brendan-ch), [David](https://github.com/dvsn0), [Jacob](https://github.com/JacobZCodes), and [Patrick](https://github.com/thisguyblink). This repository contains code for the native iOS app.

## Running the code

To build and run the project, you'll need a Mac with Xcode 15.x installed. To use the video recording feature, you'll need a physical iPhone running iOS 17.x.

Clone the repository and open the `.xcodeproj` file. You'll most likely be asked to select a development team, which you can do under "Signing and Capabilities" under the project settings.

If you haven't already, [enable development mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) on your iPhone.

Connect your iPhone and select from the device menu (located on the top); then, run `Cmd` + `R` to install and run the app.
